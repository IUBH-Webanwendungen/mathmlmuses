## Why?

This collection of snippets is made to represent on the web
a few attempts ("musings") toward activating or observing features
of MathML, present, past or future.

## Who ?

Currently maintained by [Paul Libbrecht](https://hoplahup.net/paul/).

## When ?

Started in 2021... with the hope that it gets bigger.

## How?

The website is built using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) based on
[Stehanie Eckles Netlify Start](https://11ty-netlify-jumpstart.netlify.app/).

The choice of infra brings an easy and clean publishing and flexible possibilities
to stage all sorts of media-types and HTML forms as part of this endeavour includes exploring
media-types for serving and exchanging MathML and the possibilities one
reaches on browsers.

The [source is on GitHub](https://github.com/polx/mathmlmuses) and the
site is hosted [on netlify](https://mathmlmuses.netlify.app/).
